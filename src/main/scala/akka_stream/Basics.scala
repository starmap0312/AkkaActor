  // 1) RunnableGraph:

  val sink: Sink[Int, Future[Int]] = Sink.fold[Int, Int](0)(_ + _)

  val sink6_1: Sink[Int, Future[Done]] = Sink.foreach(println(_))
  val runnable6_1: RunnableGraph[NotUsed] = source6_1.via(flow6_1).to(sink6_1)

  // Starting from a Source
  val runnable6_2: RunnableGraph[NotUsed] = source6_1.to(sink6_1)
  println(runnable6_2.run()) // NotUsed, with side effect of printing out 1, 2, 3

  // 7) Back-pressure: a downstream Subscriber is able to receive and buffer (i.e. demand), and
  //    the upstream Publisher (i.e. Source in Akka Streams) guarantees that it will never emit more elements than the total demand
  // i) Slow Publisher, fast Subscriber: no back-pressure needed, but as the sending rate could change at any time, we may still need to safeguard
  //    i.e. push-mode: Publisher continues to produce elements as fast as it can, since the pending demand will be recovered just-in-time while it is emitting element
  //ii) Fast Publisher, slow Subscriber: back-pressure is needed, by applying one of the below strategies:
  //    a) do not generate elements: reduce upstream sending rate
  //    b) "buffer elements" in a bounded manner until more demand is signalled
  //    c) "drop elements" until more demand is signalled
  //    d) tear down the stream if unable to apply any of the above strategies
  //    i.e. pull-mode: pull the elements from the Publisher

  // 8) Stream Materialization
  //    a) constructing flows and graphs is like preparing a blueprint, an execution plan
  //    b) materialization is the process of allocating resources it needs in order to run, i.e. starting up Actors for the processing, ex. opening files or socket connections etc.
  //    c) materialization is triggered by the "terminal operations", ex. run() and runWith() methods defined on Source and Flow, or by syntactic sugars, ex. runForeach(el => ...), which is alias of runWith(Sink.foreach(el => ...))
  //    d) materialization is performed synchronously by an ActorSystem global "Materializer"
  //    e) the actual stream processing is handled by actors started up during the streams materialization, running on the thread pools defaults to the ActorSystem "dispatcher"

  // 9) Operator Fusion: Akka Streams will fuse the stream operators, meaning the processing steps within fused operators are executed by one Actor
  //    a) passing elements between fused operators is fast (no asynchronous messaging overhead)
  //    b) fused operators do not run in parallel (up to one CPU core is used for each fused part)

  //10) Combining materialized values: every operator can provide a materialized value after being materialized
  //    it is necessary to express how these values should be composed to a final value when we plug these operators together

  // Insert a throttler Flow
  val source10_1: Source[Int, NotUsed] = Source(1 to 3)
  val throttler10_1: Flow[Int, Int, NotUsed] = Flow[Int].throttle(elements = 1, per = 1.second) // Create a flow that throttles elements to 1/second

  val runnable10_1: RunnableGraph[Future[Done]] = source10_1.via(throttler10_1).toMat(sink10_1)(Keep.right) // by default: the materialized value of the leftmost stage is preserved

  println(Await.result(runnable10_1.run(), 3.seconds)) // Done, need to wait for at least 3 seconds as there is a throttler

  // By default, the materialized value of the leftmost stage is preserved
  val source10_2: Source[Int, Promise[Option[Int]]] = Source.maybe[Int] // Create source that can be signalled explicitly from the outside
  val throttler10_2: Flow[Int, Int, NotUsed] = Flow[Int].throttle(elements = 1, per = 1.second) // Create a flow that throttles elements to 1/second
  val sink10_2: Sink[Int, Future[Int]] = Sink.head[Int] // Create a sink that returns the first element of a stream in the returned Future
  val runnable10_2: RunnableGraph[Promise[Option[Int]]] = source10_2.via(throttler10_2).to(sink10_2) // By default, the materialized value of the leftmost stage is preserved

  // Simple selection of materialized values by using Keep.right

  val runnable10_4: RunnableGraph[Future[Int]] = source10_4.toMat(sink10_2)(Keep.right) // use right flows's materialized value

  // Using runWith will always give the materialized values of the stages added by runWith() itself
  val source10_5: Source[Int, Promise[Option[Int]]] = source10_2.via(throttler10_2) // left stage's materialized is preserved
  val runnable10_5: Future[Int] = source10_5.runWith(sink10_2)  // use runWith's materialized value, i.e. sink10_2's materialized value

  val sink10_6: Sink[Int, NotUsed] = throttler10_2.to(sink10_2) // left stage's materialized is preserved
  val runnable10_6: Promise[Option[Int]] = sink10_6.runWith(source10_2) // use runWith's materialized value, i.e. source10_2's materialized value

  val runnable10_7: (Promise[Option[Int]], Future[Int]) = throttler10_2.runWith(source10_2, sink10_2) // use runWith's materialized value, i.e. source10_2's and sink10_2's materialized value

  // More complex  selection of materialized values by using Keep.both
  val source10_8: Source[Int, (Promise[Option[Int]], NotUsed)] = source10_2.viaMat(throttler10_2)(Keep.both) // use both flows' materialized values
  val runnable10_8: RunnableGraph[(Promise[Option[Int]], NotUsed)] = source10_8.to(sink10_2) // left stage's materialized is preserved

  val source10_9: Source[Int, (Promise[Option[Int]], NotUsed)] = source10_2.viaMat(throttler10_2)(Keep.both) // use both flows' materialized values
  val runnable10_9: RunnableGraph[((Promise[Option[Int]], NotUsed), Future[Int])] = source10_9.toMat(sink10_2)(Keep.both) // use both flows' materialized values


  // map over the materialized values, ex. in runnable10_9 we had a doubly nested pair, we can flatten it out as the following
  val runnable10_10: RunnableGraph[(Promise[Option[Int]], NotUsed, Future[Int])] = runnable10_9.mapMaterializedValue {
    case ((promise, notused), future) => (promise, notused, future)
  }
  // then we can use pattern matching to get the resulting materialized values
  val (promise, notused, future) = runnable10_10.run()

  // Type inference works as expected
  promise.success(None)
  future.map(_ + 3)

  // 11) Source pre-materialization: need a Source materialized value before the Source gets hooked up to the rest of the graph, ex. Source.queue, Source.actorRef or Source.maybe
  val completeWithDone: PartialFunction[Any, CompletionStrategy] = { case Done => CompletionStrategy.immediately }
  val actorPoweredSource: Source[String, ActorRef] = Source.actorRef[String](

    failureMatcher = PartialFunction.empty,

  ) // Create a "materialized-value powered Source", a Source of String powered by its materialized value, ActorRef, used to produce elements

  // as we need to materialize the stream in order to obtain the materialized value actorRef, but we do not want to run it now,
  // so we use preMaterialize() to obtain the materialized value and "another Source"
  val (actorRef, source_11): (ActorRef, Source[String, NotUsed]) = actorPoweredSource.preMaterialize()

  // the actor is allocated, so we could send it the messages, elements of String
  actorRef ! "Hello!"
  actorRef ! "World!"

  source_11.runWith(Sink.foreach(println)) // Hello! World!: run the "another Source" now

  // Stream ordering: Akka Streams almost all computation operators "preserve input order of elements"
  // i.e. if inputs {IA1, IA2, ..., IAn} "cause" outputs {OA1, OA2, ..., OAk} and
  //      if inputs {IB1, IB2, ..., IBm} "cause" outputs {OB1, OB2, ..., OBl} and
  //      if all of IAi happened before all IBi:
  //    then OAi happens before OBi

  // 12) Actor Materializer Lifecycle:
  //     Materializer: turn the stream blueprint into a running stream and emitting the "materialized value"
  //     a) When run by the system materializer the streams will run until the ActorSystem is shut down
  //     b) the usual way to terminate streams is to  cancel or complete them
  //     c) When the materializer is shut down before the streams have run to completion, they will be terminated abruptly
